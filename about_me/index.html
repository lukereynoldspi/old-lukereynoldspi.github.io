>I am Luke Reynolds, I am currently working towards my bachelors degree in Computer Science, and would like
to become a game or application developer. My hobbies include writing, game design, and art. I also
love history and would like to write a book some day. This portfolio inludes various activities of my Computer Science
classes, and will continually be updated in the future. I will also include
coding exercises I like to do in my freetime among other things.
